On November 23rd, 2015 I got my first job as a professional software developer. After over 5 years of flirting with software development as a hobby, launching [MyStockIQ](http://mystockiq.com/ "MyStockIQ"), and attending MakerSquare, I finally decided to take the plunge and become a fulltime developer at [CoverHound.](http://coverhound.com/ "CoverHound") Here are my initial observations after joining the industry.

### The Hours Are Amazing

Compared to my previous jobs the hours and flexibility that developers get are off the charts. It it not uncommon for an engineer to show up at the office at 10 AM and leave at 5 PM. And that is if they show up that day at all. Working from home is an option on any day, for any reason. The reality is though, **I code for 12 hours a day.** I write a blog post, or I fix a project, or I do work for CoverHound. This is mostly a personal choice that I make because I want to learn more and expand my skills, but this is relatively common in the field of software development.

### Every Line of Code is Scrutinized

I have never paid more attention to every line of code before. I work on a team of about five engineers, and there is a peer review system in place for any new code that is contributed. Every single line of code is up for scrutiny during the code review, and my team does not hesitate to point out poorly named variables, small opportunities to reduce repetitive code, or a missing semicolon or extra line break. So far, this level of detail has been difficult to accomodate at times, but I am producing much higher quality code.

### The Developer

Developers create a very unique culture in the office. They are typically very smart, introverted, and quirky in their own way. Soylent is a popular topic of conversation, complicated jokes that no one understands are 100% the norm, and we play video games everyday after work. I love getting to work with people that push my intelligence, and have similar interests as me, but it can be waring at times as well. Developers tend to be a bit stubborn in their approach, so giving feedback can be tricky. And I have only seen a few natural leaders that were also developers. Because of the peronsality type attracted to this work, people who are good at managing people, and being extroverted and communicative are very rare. So far, I feel happy and at home on the development team, but I am also happy that I have had the previous experience in a different industry so that I can see the contrasts.

Development attracts a very unique type of person, and compared to my previous job in marketing, they create a very different type of work culture.


### Engineers Are So Smart

One of the reasons that I left my last job in marketing was because I felt that I related to the quote "If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room".
