On November 23rd, 2015 I got my first job as a professional software developer. After over 5 years of flirting with software development as a hobby, launching [MyStockIQ](http://mystockiq.com/ "MyStockIQ"), and attending MakerSquare, I finally decided to take the plunge and become a fulltime developer at [CoverHound.](http://coverhound.com/ "CoverHound") Here are my initial observations after joining the industry.

### The Hours Are Amazing

Compared to my previous jobs the hours and flexibility that developers get are off the charts. It it not uncommon for an engineer to show up at the office at 10 AM and leave at 5 PM. And that is if they show up that day at all. Working from home is an option on any day, for any reason. The reality is though, **I code for 12 hours a day.** I write a blog post, or I fix a project, or I do work for CoverHound. This is mostly a personal choice that I make because I want to learn more and expand my skills, but this is relatively common in the field of software development.

### Every Line of Code is Scrutinized

I have never paid more attention to every line of code before. I work on a team of about five engineers, and there is a peer review system in place for any new code that is contributed. Every single line of code is up for scrutiny during the code review, and my team does not hesitate to point out poorly named variables, small opportunities to reduce repetitive code, or a missing semicolon or extra line break. So far, this level of detail has been difficult to accomodate at times, but I am producing much higher quality code than I ever have before.

### Releasing is Stressful

Crunch time in software development is the release of new code. When I first started my job at CoverHound, I started to wonder where the intensity in the job would come from. My first few weeks were very relaxed and low pressure, but gradually the pressure increased up until we released a feature we had been working on for months. I thought that releases would be well planned and organized, but the pressure to ship code and new features, combined with the complexity of bug fixing, testing, and feature development, leads to a final flurry of last-minute finalizations that make the actual launch a a fluid event. It feels like a lot of pressure to get everything working perfectly before the code is shipped, and nobody wants to be the one holding up the boat with buggy code. The light at the end of the tunnel is that the code does finally get released and every does get to take a bit of a breather and celebrate the big release.

So far, I am finding being a software developer a more challenging job than any other I have tried so far. I am enjoying it, as it is forcing me to be more diligent and detail-focused than ever before. And I am also really enjoying learning the process of software development. I am looking forward to applying my new understanding of the process of software development on future projects.
