On November 23rd, 2015 I got my first job as a professional software developer. After over 5 years of flirting with software development as a hobby, and launching [MyStockIQ](http://mystockiq.com/ "MyStockIQ") as a side project, I finally decided to take the full plunge and become a developer as a full-time profession. Here are my initial surprising observations from inside the belly of the beast.

### The Hours Are Amazing

Compared to my previous jobs the hours and flexibility that engineers get are off the charts. It it not uncommon for an engineer to show up at the office at 10 AM and leave at 5 PM. And that is if they show up that day at all. Working from home is an option on any day, for any reason. There is a trade-off here though. Late mornings will be replaced by late nights. No one cares about what time you walk into the office, but they do care that projects are getting completed and that code contributions are being made. I suspect that this also varies widely between companies depending on the culture, but this has been my experience so far.

### Details, Details, Details

This has been the most difficult aspect of professional software development for me so far. The precision that is required for developing code in a team environment is greater than in any other work that I have experienced. There are three main considerations for every piece of code that I submit:
* Does it work? Is it bug free? Will the product manager be satisfied. 

### Creativity?

### Engineers Are So Odd

It is great to get to work with engineers, and sometimes difficult at the same time.

### Everyone Is Smart

One of the reasons that I left my last job in marketing was because I felt that I related to the quote "If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room".
