Pair programming can be difficult for new programmers. New engineers expect coding to be a solitary experience where they will get to work in relative isolation from other engineers, and they are surprised to discover this is not the case. Pair programming is a regular part of software development, which entails working very closely with another engineer to write new code. To learn how to best appraoch this process, see my 4 tips below!

### 1. Keep It Fun & Light Hearted
My number one rule of pair programming is to HAVE FUN! Having more fun while working is what I enjoy the most about pair programming, so I always try to make to jokes and have fun while pairing. I believe that good pairs are fun to work with, even in the face of difficulties. Making pair programming enjoyable goes a long way to making you more productive and getting the job done.


### 2. Not A Competition
Pair programming is not a competition. Being competitive within your pair can result in disengagement and alienation of your pair. Remember that the goal of pair programming is not to prove to someone else that you are right, but rather to create the best code possible. Pairs should celebrate their completion of the task and the quality of their code, not being "right". Always share credibility with your pair, even if you believe that you came up with the solution single-handedly, your pair undoubtedly contributed to the solution as well.


### 3. Stay With Your Pair
It can be tempting to diverge from your pair if you significantly differ in your approach to a problem. You may be tempted to break off and each attempt to solve the problem in your own way, but this eliminates the power of pair programming, since you are no longer working together on the solution. A better approach is to discuss with your pair which solution is theoretically better, and pursue that solution first. If the solution cannot be arrived at, change directions and pursue a new solution. To stick with your pair, you must be simultaneously flexible in your approach, and also persuasive with your communication when you do have a better approach to a problem. If you do pursue your solution, and it is correct, remember to not be overly competitive, and that your pair was an equal contributor in the ultimate solution to the problem.


### 4. Give Feedback
Giving feedback is one of the most important aspects to developing a strong rapport with your pair. It can be difficult to critique another person on their work or their approach, but it is critical for the development of both partners. By providing timely feedback, you can improve the weaknesses of your partner, and when your feedback is constructive and appropriate, it will actually improve both your pair's work, and your relationship with your pair.
