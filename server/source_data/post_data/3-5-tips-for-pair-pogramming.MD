Pair programming can be an difficult experience for new programmers. Sometimes new engineers expect coding to be a solitary experience where they will get to work in relative isolation from other engineers, and they are surprised to discover this is not the case. See the tips below for how to navigate the early pitfalls of pair programming.

### 1. Pair Management
When pairing with someone that I have never paired with before, I expect to put between 20-40% of my energy towards the management of my pair. This is for a whole host of reasons. 

* My pair may be a better coder than me, which means I need to put some effort into making sure they're going slow enough for me to understand what is going on. 

* I may be a faster coder than them, which means I need to put some extra effort into making sure that they are keeping up and we are on the same page. 

* We may have different coding styles, and may have some differences to resolve to make sure that we are producing the best code possible.

Pair management is all about keeping an open mind, and understanding that your pair is likely in a different place from you, and you will need to put some effort into keeping in sync with your pair. 


### 2. Not A Competition
Pair programming is not a competition. Being competitive within your pair can result in disengagement and alienation of your pair. Remember that the goal of pair programming is not to prove to someone else that you are right, but rather to create the best code possible. Pairs should celebrate their completion of the task and the quality of their code, not being "right". Always share credibility with your pair, even if you believe that you came up with the solution single-handedly, your pair undoubtedly contributed to the solution as well.


### 3. Stay With Your Pair
It can be tempting to diverge from your pair if you significantly differ in your approach to a problem. You may be tempted to break off and each attempt to solve the problem in your own way, but this eliminates the power of pair programming, since you are no longer working together on the solution. A better approach is to discuss with your pair which solution is theoretically better, and pursue that solution first. If the solution cannot be arrived at, change directions and pursue a new solution. To stick with your pair, you must be simultaneously flexible in your approach, and also persuasive with your communication when you do have a better approach to a problem. If you do pursue your solution, and it is correct, remember to not be overly competitive, and that your pair was an equal contributor in the ultimate solution to the problem.


### 4. Give Feedback
Giving feedback is one of the most important aspects to developing a strong rapport with your pair. It can be difficult to critique another person on their work or their approach, but it is critical for the development of both partners. By providing timely feedback, you can improve the weaknesses of your partner, and when your feedback is constructive and appropriate, it will actually improve the relationship of the pair.


### 5. Keep it Fun & Light-Hearted
Coding can be difficult and frustrating. Good pairs are fun to work with, even in the face of difficulties. Keeping the tone of your dialog light and fun can create a more enjoyable coding experience and make your pair more relaxed and more open to giving input and providing feedback for you.
