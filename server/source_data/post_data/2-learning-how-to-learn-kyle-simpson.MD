### Learning How To Learn, With Kyle Simpson

Kyle Simpson(@getify) is the head of curriculum at MakerSquare, the software development immersive program that I attended. He gave us a lecture on how the most important thing that we could learn while attending MakerSquare **was learning how to learn.**

Here Kyle's key points on learning how to learn

### Have Deeper Understanding

What we currently incentivize in the field of software engineering is grinding out features, but not necessarily complete understanding of the code that we write. One problem that arises is that if you do not know why a piece of code works, you dont have any hope of fixing it when it breaks. Instead of understanding the problem, we often times jump directly to the solution, without understanding the fundumental cause. There is conflict between understanding and getting things done that we must overcome so that we can gain true understanding.

> curiosity and understanding than any of your peers" - Kyle Simpson

### Two Most Important Principles to Take Away From a Learning Environment

##### How to Learn

The practices by which you go through of asking questions and researching material to gain true conceptual understanding. You must understand not only the solution to the problem, but how you went about solving a problem.

##### How to want to learn

How to establish a motivation for learning. A good job with good pay will get you into the industry of software engineering. But you should continually figure out how to be better at the job that you have. We should seek to be an uncommon level of engineer - we should have an unbelievable thirst for understanding at a deeper level. Self-motivation is key. Money wont always be the motivating factor. Our own natural curiosity is a great gift and privledge that should be nurtured through exercise.

You can build intrisic motivating factors through habit making. You can become more curious and want to learn things more deeply. Go look at the source code for backbone and angular, to understand what it is doing. Dont stop with the answer to the first question. Keep asking questions and make wanting to learn intrinsic.

### Final Tips:

The challenge is to keep going after graduation. Learning doesnt stop after MakerSquare. We prepare to learn at MakerSquare, but the real learning is in the real world.

Learn the problem deeper so that you can teach it better in the code that you write.

Understanding of the code is the primary metric of the quality of the code.

Don't treat things as black-boxes. Understand the wheel that you put onto the car.

There is no more skating by doing the same thing that you have always done.

Find a balance a mix between learning and doing. Doing only one will not serve you.
