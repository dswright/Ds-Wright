###The Idea

ProductSquare is a platform for students to showcase the projects they have completed while learning to code in a bootcamp. Additionally, ProductSquare is a platform for non-profit companies to come and make proposals for student projects.

### ProductSquare Team

ProductSquare was worked on by 5 students at MakerSquare (including myself):

* [codeNameAtlas](https://github.com/codeNameAtlas "See the github profile for CodeNameAtlas")
* [viinasu](https://github.com/viinasu "See the github profile for viinasu")
* [jkf91](https://github.com/jkf91 "See the github profile for jkf91")
* [sinwailam193](https://github.com/sinwailam193 "see the github profile for sinwailam193")
* [dswright](https://github.com/dswright "see the github profile for dswright")

### Technology Stack for ProductSquare

* Node & Express on the backend
* Angular.js on the frontend
* Firebase for storage
* Gulp for deployment automation
* Heroku for hosting

### ProductSquare Postmortem 

I really wanted ProductSquare to become a product that would actually be used by bootcamp students to showcase their work. Unfortunately, we bit off more than we could chew, and we were not able to build a complete platform in 3 weeks.

#### 3 Things I learned

* How to do colored overlays with css to create a very nice hover effect.

* How to setup gulp as an automated deployment handler.

* How to structure an Angular.js app.

#### 3 Things I would Do Differently

* I would have used React instead of Angular. I have found since doing this project that I like React much more than Angular.

* I would not have used a commercial design template as the basis for our design. Taking small bits of a design instead of an entire template leads to much better control of code.

* I would have reduced the scope of our project to only focus on the showcasing of projects so that we could create a very polished product.

Overall, I really enjoyed working on the project, had a lot of fun with my team, and we learned a ton of JavaScript in the development process!
