### Dreamchart

> Dreamchart won best use of the LevelMoney API at [DeveloperWeek2016](http://developerweek.com)

Dreamchart is a simple mobile application built to help people acheive their savings goals. Built using Capital One's LevelMoney API, Dreamchart taps into people's spending history and helps them visualize goals and attain them faster using money saving opportunities.

### Building Dreamchart

Dreamchart came together over the course of 24 hours at the developer week hackathon in 2016. We had a great time building it and mostly wanted to build a simple application that could help people better spend their money and better develop financial habits. We had some trouble setting up React with browserify and babelify for compiling our app. We were eventually able to over come these obstacles and build a simple app that helps individuals analyze their financial spending history and improve their spending habits.
